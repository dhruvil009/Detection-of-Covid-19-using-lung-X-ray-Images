# Detection-of-Covid-19-using-lung-X-ray-Images
In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, radiological imaging can play an important role in the early diagnosis of the disease. Chest radiography can detect a few characteristic findings in the lung associated with COVID-19. Our proposed model aims to primarily implement Convolutional neural networks, introducing different filters on each layer to provide diagnostics for binary classification - COVID vs. No Findings.
